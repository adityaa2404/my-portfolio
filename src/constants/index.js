export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hi! I’m Aditya Potdar, an Electronics and Computer Engineering student deeply interested in Data Structures & Algorithms, Full Stack Development, and Competitive Programming. I actively practice DSA using Striver’s Sheet and regularly participate in coding contests to sharpen my problem-solving skills. I’m also learning the MERN stack to build scalable, real-world web applications. Previously, I’ve worked on ML-based projects like crop disease detection, but my current focus is on writing clean code, solving complex problems, and becoming a well-rounded developer. I'm driven by a strong curiosity and a constant desire to grow through hands-on learning.`;
